# Student Profiles

This project displays student profiles and was created for hatchways.io's frontend web development assessment using Angular and Angular/Material. It demonstrates the uses of fetching, manipulating, as well as presenting data efficiently by allowing the user to minimize or expand heavy data and extra options. Users can also search for student profiles by name and/or by tags for fast navigation.
